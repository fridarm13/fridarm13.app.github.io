	<h1>'Tis Is The Damn Season</h1>
	<p>If I wanted to know who you were hanging with<br>
While I was gone, I would've asked you<br>
It's the kind of cold fogs up windshield glass<br>
But I felt it when I passed you<br>
There's an ache in you put there by the ache in me<br>
But if it's all the same to you<br>
It's the same to me<br>
<br>
So we could call it even<br>
You could call me Babe for the weekend<br>
'Tis the damn season, write this down<br>
I'm stayin' at my parents' house<br>
And the road not taken looks real good now<br>
And it always leads to you and my hometown<br>
<br>
I parkеd my car right between the Methodist<br>
And thе school that used to be ours<br>
The holidays linger like bad perfume<br>
You can run, but only so far<br>
I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave<br>
But if it's okay with you<br>
It's okay with me<br>
<br>
We could call it even<br>
You could call me Babe for the weekend<br>
'Tis the damn season, write this down<br>
I'm stayin' at my parents' house<br>
And the road not taken looks real good now<br>
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires<br>
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out<br>
We could just ride around<br>
And the road not taken looks real good now<br>
And it always leads to you and my hometown<br>
<br>
Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake<br>
I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay<br>
So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends<br>
Who'll write books about me, if I ever make it<br>
And wonder about the only soul who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'<br>
And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own<br>
<br>
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known<br>
We could call it even<br>
Even though I'm leavin'<br>
And I'll be yours for the weekend<br>
'Tis the damn season<br>
<br>
We could call it even<br>
You could call me Babe for the weekend<br>
'Tis the damn season, write this down<br>
I'm stayin' at my parents' house<br>
And the road not taken looks real good now<br>
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires<br>
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out<br>
We could just ride around<br>
And the road not taken looks real good now<br>
And it always leads to you and my hometown<br>
<br>
It always leads to you and my hometown</p>
