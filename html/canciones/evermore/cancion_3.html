	<h1>Gold Rush</h1>
	<p>Gleaming, twinkling<br>
Eyes like sinking<br>
Ships on waters<br>
So inviting<br>
I almost jump in<br>
<br>
I don't like a gold rush, gold rush<br>
I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush<br>
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch<br>
Everybody wants you<br>
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you<br>
Walk past, quick brush<br>
I don't like slow motion double vision in rose blush<br>
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush<br>
Everybody wants you<br>
But I don't like a gold rush<br>
<br>
What must it be like<br>
To grow up that beautiful?<br>
With your hair falling into place like dominos<br>
I see me padding across your wooden floors<br>
With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door<br>
At dinner parties<br>
I call you out on your contrarian shit<br>
And the coastal town<br>
We wandered 'round had never<br>
Seen a love as pure as it<br>
And then it fades into the gray of my day old tea<br>
'Cause it could never be<br>
<br>
'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush<br>
I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush<br>
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch<br>
Everybody wants you<br>
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you<br>
Walk past, quick brush<br>
I don't like slow motion double vision in rose blush<br>
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush<br>
Everybody wants you<br>
And I don't like a gold rush<br>
<br>
What must it be like<br>
To grow up that beautiful?<br>
With your hair falling into place like dominos<br>
My mind turns your life into folklore<br>
I can't dare to dream about you anymore<br>
At dinner parties<br>
Won't call you out on your contrarian shit<br>
And the coastal town<br>
We never found will never<br>
See a love as pure as it<br>
'Cause it fades into the gray of my day old tea<br>
'Cause it will never be<br>
<br>
Gleaming, twinkling<br>
Eyes like sinking<br>
Ships on waters<br>
So inviting<br>
I almost jump in</p>
