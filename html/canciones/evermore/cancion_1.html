	<h1>Willow</h1>
	<p>I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night<br>
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife<br>
And if it was an open-shut case<br>
I never would have known from the look on your face<br>
Lost in your current like a priceless wine<br>
<br>
The more that you say, the less I know<br>
Wherever you stray, I follow<br>
I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
Wreck my plans, that's my man<br>
<br>
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind<br>
Head on the pillow, I can feel you sneakin' in<br>
As if you are a mythical thing<br>
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring<br>
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win<br>
<br>
The more that you say, the less I know<br>
Wherever you stray, I follow<br>
I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
Wreck my plans, that's my man<br>
You know that my train could take you home<br>
Anywhere else is hollow<br>
I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
Wreck my plans, that's my man<br>
<br>
Life was a willow, and it bent right to your wind<br>
They count me out time and time again<br>
Life was a willow, and it bent right to your wind<br>
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend<br>
<br>
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark<br>
Show me the places where the others gave you scars<br>
Now this is an open-shut case<br>
I guess I should've known from the look on your face<br>
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art<br>
<br>
The more that you say, the less I know<br>
Wherever you stray, I follow<br>
I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
Wreck my plans, that's my man<br>
You know that my train could take you home<br>
Anywhere else is hollow<br>
I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
Wreck my plans, that's my man<br>
<br>
The more that you say, the less I know<br>
Wherever you stray, I follow<br>
I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
Wreck my plans, that's my man<br>
You know that my train could take you home<br>
Anywhere else is hollow<br>
I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
Wreck my plans, that's my man<br>
<br>
Hey, that's my man<br>
That's my man<br>
Yeah, that's my man<br>
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art<br>
That's my man<br>
Hey, that's my man<br>
I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
Wreck my plans, that's my man</p>
