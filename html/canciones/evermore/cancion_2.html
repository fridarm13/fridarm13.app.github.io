	<h1>Champagne Problems</h1>
	<p>You booked the night train for a reason<br>
So you could sit there in this hurt<br>
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers<br>
You're not sure which is worse<br>
<br>
Because I dropped your hand while dancing<br>
Left you out there standing<br>
Crestfallen on the landing<br>
Champagne problems<br>
Your mom's ring in your pocket<br>
My picture in your wallet<br>
Your heart was glass, I dropped it<br>
Champagne problems<br>
<br>
You told your family for a reason<br>
You couldn't keep it in<br>
Your sister splashed out on the bottle<br>
Now no one's celebrating<br>
<br>
Dom Perignon, you brought it<br>
No crowd of friends applauded<br>
Your hometown skeptics called it<br>
Champagne problems<br>
You had a speech, you're speechless<br>
Love slipped beyond your reaches<br>
And I couldn't give a reason<br>
Champagne problems<br>
<br>
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door<br>
November flush and your flannel cure<br>
This dorm was once a madhouse<br>
I made a joke: Well, it's made for me<br>
How evergreen, our group of friends<br>
Don't think we'll say that word again<br>
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls<br>
That we once walked through<br>
One for the money, two for the show<br>
I never was ready so I watch you go<br>
Sometimes you just don't know the answer<br>
Till someone's on their knees and asks you<br>
She would've made such a lovely bride<br>
What a shame she's fucked in the head, they said<br>
But you'll find the real thing instead<br>
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred<br>
<br>
And hold your hand while dancing<br>
Never leave you standing<br>
Crestfallen on the landing<br>
With champagne problems<br>
Your mom's ring in your pocket<br>
Her picture in your wallet<br>
You won't remember all my<br>
Champagne problems<br>
<br>
You won't remember all my<br>
Champagne problems</p>
