	<h1>Tolerate It</h1>
	<p>I sit and watch you reading with your head low<br>
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed<br>
I sit and watch you<br>
I notice everything you do or don't do<br>
You're so much older and wiser and I<br>
<br>
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid<br>
Use my best colors for your portrait<br>
Lay the table with the fancy shit<br>
And watch you tolerate it<br>
If it's all in my head, tell me now<br>
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow<br>
I know my love should be celebrated<br>
But you tolerate it<br>
<br>
I greet you with a battle hero's welcome<br>
I take your indiscretions all in good fun<br>
I sit and listеn<br>
I polish plates until they gleam and glistеn<br>
You're so much older and wiser and I<br>
<br>
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid<br>
Use my best colors for your portrait<br>
Lay the table with the fancy shit<br>
And watch you tolerate it<br>
If it's all in my head, tell me now<br>
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow<br>
I know my love should be celebrated<br>
But you tolerate it<br>
<br>
While you were out building other worlds, where was I?<br>
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?<br>
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky<br>
Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life<br>
Drawing hearts in the byline<br>
Always taking up too much space or time<br>
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I<br>
<br>
Break free and leave us in ruins<br>
Took this dagger in me and removed it<br>
Gain the weight of you then lose it<br>
Believe me, I could do it<br>
If it's all in my head, tell me now<br>
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow<br>
I know my love should be celebrated<br>
But you tolerate it<br>
<br>
I sit and watch you</p>
