	<h1>Teardrops on My Guitar</h1>
	<p>Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see<br>
That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be<br>
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about<br>
And she's got everything that I have to live without<br>
<br>
Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's just so funny<br>
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me<br>
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right<br>
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night<br>
<br>
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar<br>
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star<br>
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do<br>
<br>
Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?<br>
And there he goes, so perfectly<br>
The kind of flawless I wish I could be<br>
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love<br>
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause<br>
<br>
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar<br>
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star<br>
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do<br>
<br>
So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light<br>
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight<br>
<br>
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar<br>
The only one who's got enough for me to break my heart<br>
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do<br>
<br>
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough<br>
And he's all that I need to fall into<br>
<br>
Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see</p>
