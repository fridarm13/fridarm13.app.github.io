	<h1>Tim Mcgraw</h1>
	<p>
	He said the way my blue eyes shined<br>
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night<br>
I said: That's a lie<br>
Just a boy in a Chevy truck that had a tendency<br>
Of getting stuck on backroads at night<br>
<br>
And I was right there beside him all summer long<br>
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone, but<br>
<br>
When you think Tim McGraw, I hope you think my favorite song<br>
The one we danced to all night long<br>
The Moon like a spotlight on the lake<br>
When you think happiness<br>
I hope you think that little black dress<br>
Think of my head on your chest<br>
And my old faded blue jeans<br>
When you think Tim McGraw<br>
I hope you think of me<br>
<br>
September saw a month of tears<br>
And thanking God that you weren't here<br>
To see me like that<br>
But in a box beneath my bed<br>
Is a letter that you never read<br>
From three summers back<br>
<br>
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet<br>
And looking back on all of that, it's nice to believe<br>
<br>
But when you think Tim McGraw<br>
I hope you think my favorite song<br>
The one we danced to all night long<br>
The Moon like a spotlight on the lake<br>
When you think happiness<br>
I hope you think that little black dress<br>
Think of my head on your chest<br>
And my old faded blue jeans<br>
When you think Tim McGraw<br>
I hope you think of me<br>
<br>
And I'm back for the first time since then<br>
I'm standing on your street<br>
And there's a letter left on your doorstep<br>
And the first thing that you'll read is<br>
<br>
When you think Tim McGraw<br>
I hope you think my favorite song<br>
Some day you'll turn your radio on<br>
I hope it takes you back to that place<br>
When you think happiness<br>
I hope you think that little black dress<br>
Think of my head on your chest<br>
And my old faded blue jeans<br>
When you think Tim McGraw<br>
I hope you think of me<br>
<br>
Oh, think of me<br>
<br>
You said the way my blue eyes shined<br>
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night<br>
I said: That's a lie
