	<h1>Sparks Fly</h1>
	<p>The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm<br>
And I'm a house of cards<br>
You're the kind of reckless that should send me running<br>
But I kinda know that I won't get far<br>
<br>
And you stood there in front of me<br>
Just close enough to touch<br>
Close enough to hope you couldn't see<br>
What I was thinking of<br>
<br>
Drop everything now<br>
Meet me in the pouring rain<br>
Kiss me on the sidewalk<br>
Take away the pain<br>
'Cause I see sparks fly<br>
Whenever you smile<br>
<br>
Get me with those green eyes, baby<br>
As the lights go down<br>
Give me something that'll haunt me<br>
When you're not around<br>
'Cause I see sparks fly<br>
Whenever you smile<br>
<br>
My mind forgets to remind me<br>
You're a bad idea<br>
You touch me once and it's really something<br>
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be<br>
<br>
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world<br>
But with you, I know it's no good<br>
And I could wait patiently, but<br>
I really wish you would<br>
<br>
Drop everything now<br>
Meet me in the pouring rain<br>
Kiss me on the sidewalk<br>
Take away the pain<br>
'Cause I see sparks fly<br>
Whenever you smile<br>
<br>
Get me with those green eyes, baby<br>
As the lights go down<br>
Give me something that'll haunt me<br>
When you're not around<br>
'Cause I see sparks fly<br>
Whenever you smile<br>
<br>
I'll run my fingers through your hair<br>
And watch the lights go wild<br>
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me<br>
It's just wrong enough to make it feel right<br>
And lead me up the staircase<br>
Won't you whisper soft and slow?<br>
I'm captivated by you, baby<br>
Like a fireworks show<br>
<br>
Drop everything now<br>
Meet me in the pouring rain<br>
Kiss me on the sidewalk<br>
Take away the pain<br>
'Cause I see sparks fly<br>
Whenever you smile<br>
<br>
Get me with those green eyes, baby<br>
As the lights go down<br>
Give me something that'll haunt me<br>
When you're not around<br>
'Cause I see sparks fly<br>
Whenever you smile<br>
<br>
And the sparks fly<br>
Oh, baby, smile<br>
And the sparks fly</p>
