	<h1>Speak Now</h1>
	<p>I am not the kind of girl<br>
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion<br>
But you are not the kind of boy<br>
Who should be marrying the wrong girl<br>
I sneak in and see your friends<br>
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel<br>
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid<br>
Somewhere back inside a room<br>
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry<br>
<br>
This is surely not what you thought it would be<br>
I lose myself in a daydream<br>
Where I stand and say<br>
<br>
Don't say yes, run away now<br>
I'll meet you when you're out<br>
Of the church at the back door<br>
Don't wait or say a single vow<br>
You need to hear me out<br>
And they said: Speak now<br>
<br>
Fond gestures are exchanged<br>
And the organ starts to play a song<br>
That sounds like a death march<br>
And I am hiding in the curtains<br>
It seems that I was uninvited<br>
By your lovely bride-to-be<br>
<br>
She floats down the aisle<br>
Like a pageant queen<br>
But I know you wish it was me<br>
You wish it was me<br>
Don't you?<br>
<br>
Don't say yes, run away now<br>
I'll meet you when you're out<br>
Of the church at the back door<br>
Don't wait or say a single vow<br>
You need to hear me out<br>
And they said: Speak now<br>
<br>
Don't say yes, run away now<br>
I'll meet you when you're out<br>
Of the church at the back door<br>
Don't wait or say a single vow<br>
Your time is runnin' out<br>
And they said: Speak now<br>
<br>
I hear the preacher say<br>
Speak now or forever hold your peace<br>
There's a silence, there's my last chance<br>
I stand up with shaky hands<br>
All eyes on me<br>
Horrified looks from everyone in the room<br>
But I'm only looking at you<br>
<br>
I am not the kind of girl<br>
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion<br>
But you are not the kind of boy<br>
Who should be marrying the wrong girl<br>
<br>
Don't say yes, run away now<br>
I'll meet you when you're out<br>
Of the church at the back door<br>
Don't wait or say a single vow<br>
You need to hear me out<br>
And they said: Speak now<br>
<br>
And you say: Let's run away now<br>
I'll meet you when I'm out<br>
Of my tux at the back door<br>
Baby, I didn't say my vow<br>
So glad you were around<br>
When they said: Speak now</p>
