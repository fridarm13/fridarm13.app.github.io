	<h1>Back To December</h1>
	<p>I'm so glad you made time to see me<br>
How's life, tell me, how's your family?<br>
I haven't seen them in a while<br>
You've been good, busier than ever<br>
We small talk, work and the weather<br>
Your guard is up and I know why<br>
<br>
Because the last time you saw me<br>
Is still burned in the back of your mind<br>
You gave me roses and I left them there to die<br>
<br>
So this is me swallowing my pride<br>
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night<br>
And I go back to December all the time<br>
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you<br>
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine<br>
I'd go back to December, turn around<br>
And make it all right<br>
I go back to December all the time<br>
<br>
These days I haven't been sleeping<br>
Staying up playing back myself leaving<br>
When your birthday passed and I didn't call<br>
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times<br>
I watched you laughing from the passenger side<br>
And realized I loved you in the fall<br>
<br>
And then the cold came with the dark days<br>
When the fear crept into my mind<br>
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye<br>
<br>
So this is me swallowing my pride<br>
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night<br>
And I go back to December all the time<br>
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you<br>
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine<br>
I'd go back to December, turn around<br>
And change my own mind<br>
I go back to December all the time<br>
<br>
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile<br>
So good to me, so right<br>
And how you held me in your arms that September night<br>
The first time you ever saw me cry<br>
Maybe this is wishful thinking<br>
Probably mindless dreaming<br>
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right<br>
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't<br>
So if the chain is on your door, I understand<br>
<br>
But this is me swallowing my pride<br>
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night<br>
And I go back to December<br>
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you<br>
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine<br>
I'd go back to December, turn around<br>
And make it all right<br>
I'd go back to December, turn around<br>
And change my own mind<br>
I go back to December all the time<br>
<br>
All the time</p>
