	<h1>Mine</h1>
	<p>Ah, ah, ah, ah<br>
Ah, ah, ah, ah<br>
<br>
You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables<br>
Left a small town, never looked back<br>
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling<br>
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts<br>
<br>
I say: Can you believe it?<br>
As we're lying on the couch<br>
The moment I could see it<br>
Yes, yes, I can see it now<br>
<br>
Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?<br>
You put your arm around me for the first time<br>
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter<br>
You are the best thing that's ever been mine<br>
<br>
Flash forward and we're taking on the world together<br>
And there's a drawer of my things at your place<br>
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded<br>
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes<br>
<br>
But we got bills to pay<br>
We got nothing figured out<br>
When it was hard to take<br>
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about<br>
<br>
Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?<br>
You put your arm around me for the first time<br>
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter<br>
You are the best thing that's ever been mine<br>
<br>
Do you remember, all the city lights on the water?<br>
You saw me start to believe for the first time<br>
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter<br>
You are the best thing that's ever been mine<br>
<br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
And I remember that fight, 2:30AM<br>
As everything was slipping right out of our hands<br>
And I ran out crying<br>
And you followed me out into the street<br>
<br>
Braced myself for the goodbye<br>
'Cause that's all I've ever known<br>
Then you took me by surprise<br>
You said: I'll never leave you alone<br>
<br>
You said: I remember how we felt sitting by the water<br>
And every time I look at you is like the first time<br>
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter<br>
She is the best thing that's ever been mine<br>
<br>
(Hold on, make it last)<br>
(Hold on, never turn back)<br>
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (hold on)<br>
You are the best thing that's ever been mine (hold on, hold on)<br>
<br>
Do you believe it? (Hold on)<br>
We're gonna make it now (hold on)<br>
And I can see it<br>
(Yeah, yeah, I can see it now, see it now)</p>
