	<h1>Dear John</h1>
	<p>Long were the nights<br>
When my days once revolved around you<br>
Counting my footsteps<br>
Praying the floor won't fall through again<br>
And my mother accused me of losing my mind<br>
But I swore I was fine<br>
<br>
You paint me a blue sky<br>
And go back and turn it to rain<br>
And I lived in your chess game<br>
But you changed the rules everyday<br>
Wondering which version of you<br>
I might get on the phone tonight<br>
Well, I stopped picking up<br>
And this song is to let you know why<br>
<br>
Dear John<br>
I see it all now that you're gone<br>
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?<br>
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home<br>
I should've known<br>
<br>
Well, maybe it's me<br>
And my blind optimism to blame<br>
Or maybe it's you, and your sick need<br>
To give love and take it away<br>
And you'll add my name<br>
To your long list of traitors who don't understand<br>
And I'll look back in regret<br>
How I ignored when they said: Run as fast as you can<br>
<br>
Dear John<br>
I see it all now that you're gone<br>
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?<br>
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home<br>
<br>
Dear John<br>
I see it all now, it was wrong<br>
Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played<br>
By your dark twisted games when I loved you so?<br>
I should've known<br>
<br>
You are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry<br>
Never impressed by me acing your tests<br>
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes<br>
'Cause you burned them out<br>
But I took your matches before fire could catch me<br>
So don't look now<br>
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town, ooh<br>
<br>
Dear John<br>
I see it all now that you're gone<br>
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?<br>
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home<br>
<br>
I see it all now that you're gone<br>
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?<br>
The girl in the dress wrote you a song<br>
You should've known<br>
<br>
You should've known<br>
Don't you think I was too young?<br>
You should've known</p>
