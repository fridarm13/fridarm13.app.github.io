	<h1>Maroon</h1>
	<p>When the morning came<br>
We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf<br>
'Cause we lost track of time again<br>
Laughing with my feet in your lap<br>
Like you were my closest friend<br>
<br>
How'd we end up on the floor, anyway?<br>
You say: Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top ros√©, that's how<br>
I see you every day now<br>
<br>
And I chose you<br>
The one I was dancing with<br>
In New York, no shoes<br>
Looked up at the sky and it was<br>
<br><br>
The burgundy on my t-shirt<br>
When you splashed your wine into me<br>
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks<br>
So scarlet, it was<br>
The mark you saw on my collarbone<br>
The rust that grew between telephones<br>
The lips I used to call home<br>
So scarlet, it was maroon<br>
<br>
When the silence came<br>
We were shaking, blind and hazy<br>
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?<br>
Sobbing with your head in your hands<br>
Ain't that the way shit always ends?<br>
<br>
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway<br>
Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us<br>
I feel you, no matter what<br>
The rubies that I gave up<br>
<br>
And I lost you<br>
The one I was dancing with<br>
In New York, no shoes<br>
Looked up at the sky and it was maroon<br>
<br>
The burgundy on my t-shirt<br>
When you splashed your wine into me<br>
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks<br>
So scarlet, it was (maroon)<br>
The mark you saw on my collarbone<br>
The rust that grew between telephones<br>
The lips I used to call home<br>
So scarlet, it was (maroon)<br>
<br>
And I wake with your memory over me<br>
That's a real fucking legacy, legacy (it was maroon)<br>
And I wake with your memory over me<br>
That's a real fucking legacy to leave<br>
<br>
The burgundy on my t-shirt<br>
When you splashed your wine into me<br>
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks<br>
So scarlet, it was maroon<br>
The mark you saw on my collarbone<br>
The rust that grew between telephones<br>
The lips I used to call home<br>
So scarlet, it was maroon<br>
<br>
It was maroon<br>
It was maroon</p>
