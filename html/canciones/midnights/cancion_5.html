	<h1>You're On Your Own, Kid</h1>
	<p>Summer went away, still, the yearning stays<br>
I play it cool with the best of them<br>
I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me<br>
It's okay, we're the best of friends<br>
Anyway<br>
<br>
I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys<br>
I touch my phone as if it's your face<br>
I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out<br>
There's just one who could make me stay<br>
All my days<br>
<br>
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes<br>
I waited ages to see you there<br>
I searched the party of better bodies<br>
Just to learn that you never cared<br>
<br>
You're on your own, kid<br>
You always have been<br>
<br>
I see the great escape, so long, Daisy Mae<br>
I picked the petals, he loves me not<br>
Something different bloomed, writing in my room<br>
I play my songs in the parking lot<br>
I'll run away<br>
<br>
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes<br>
I called a taxi to take me there<br>
I searched the party of better bodies<br>
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare<br>
<br>
You're on your own, kid<br>
You always have been<br>
<br>
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes<br>
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this<br>
I hosted parties and starved my body<br>
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss<br>
<br>
The jokes weren't funny, I took the money<br>
My friends from home don't know what to say<br>
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown<br>
And I saw something they can't take away<br>
<br>
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned<br>
Everything you lose is a step you take<br>
So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it<br>
You've got no reason to be afraid<br>
<br>
You're on your own, kid<br>
Yeah, you can face this<br>
You're on your own, kid<br>
You always have been</p>
