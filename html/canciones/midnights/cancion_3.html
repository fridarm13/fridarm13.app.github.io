	<h1>Anti-Hero</h1>
	<p>I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser<br>
Midnights become my afternoons<br>
When my depression works the graveyard shift<br>
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room<br>
<br>
I should not be left to my own devices<br>
They come with prices and vices<br>
I end up in crisis<br>
(Tale as old as time)<br>
<br>
I wake up screaming from dreaming<br>
One day I'll watch as you're leaving<br>
'Cause you got tired of my scheming<br>
(For the last time)<br>
<br>
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me<br>
At teatime, everybody agrees<br>
I'll stare directly at the Sun, but never in the mirror<br>
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero<br>
<br>
Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby<br>
And I'm a monster on the hill<br>
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city<br>
Pierced through the heart, but never killed<br>
<br>
Did you hear my covert narcissism<br>
Lightly disguised as altruism<br>
Like some kind of congressman?<br>
(Tale as old as time)<br>
<br>
I wake up screaming from dreaming<br>
One day I'll watch as you're leaving<br>
And life will lose all of its meaning<br>
(For the last time)<br>
<br>
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)<br>
At teatime, everybody agrees<br>
I'll stare directly at the Sun, but never in the mirror<br>
It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero<br>
<br>
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money<br>
She thinks I left them in the will<br>
The family gathers around and reads it and someone screams out<br>
She's laughing up at us from hell<br>
<br>
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me<br>
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me<br>
It's me, hi, everybody agrees, everybody agrees<br>
<br>
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)<br>
At teatime, everybody agrees (everybody agrees)<br>
I'll stare directly at the Sun, but never in the mirror<br>
It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero</p>
