	<h1>Snow On The Beach (Ft. Lana Del Rey)</h1>
	<p>One night, a few Moons ago<br>
I saw flecks of what could've been lights<br>
But it might just have been you<br>
Passing by unbeknownst to me<br>
<br>
Life is emotionally abusive<br>
And time can't stop me quite like you did<br>
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking<br>
I'm unglued, thanks to you<br>
<br>
And it's like snow at the beach<br>
Weird, but fucking beautiful<br>
Flying in a dream<br>
Stars by the pocketful<br>
You wanting me<br>
Tonight feels impossible<br>
But it's coming down<br>
No sound, it's all around<br>
<br>
Like snow on the beach<br>
Like snow on the beach<br>
Like snow on the beach<br>
Like snow, ah<br>
<br>
This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen<br>
I searched: Aurora borealis green<br>
I've never seen someone lit from within<br>
Blurring out my periphery<br>
<br>
My smile is like I won a contest<br>
And to hide that would be so dishonest<br>
And it's fine to fake it till you make it<br>
Till you do, till it's true<br>
<br>
Now it's like snow at the beach<br>
Weird, but fucking beautiful<br>
Flying in a dream<br>
Stars by the pocketful<br>
You wanting me<br>
Tonight feels impossible<br>
But it's coming down<br>
No sound, it's all around<br>
<br>
Like snow on the beach<br>
Like snow on the beach<br>
Like snow on the beach<br>
Like snow, ah<br>
<br>
I (I) can't (can't) speak, afraid to jinx it<br>
I (I) don't (don't) even dare to wish it<br>
But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet<br>
Now I'm all for you like Janet<br>
Can this be a real thing? Can it?<br>
<br>
Are we falling like snow at the beach? (Snow at the beach)<br>
Weird, but fucking beautiful<br>
Flying in a dream (flying in a dream)<br>
Stars by the pocketful<br>
You wanting me (you wanting me)<br>
Tonight feels impossible<br>
But it's coming down<br>
No sound, it's all around<br>
<br>
Like snow on the beach (snow on the beach)<br>
Like snow on the beach (snow on the beach)<br>
Like snow on the beach (snow on the beach)<br>
Like snow, ah<br>
It's coming down<br>
No sound, it's all around<br>
<br>
Like snow on the beach<br>
(It's coming down, it's coming down)<br>
(It's coming down, it's coming down)<br>
Like snow on the beach<br>
(It's coming down, it's coming down)<br>
(It's coming down, it's coming down)<br>
(It's coming down, it's coming down)<br>
(It's coming down, it's coming down)<br>
(It's coming down, it's coming down)<br>
(It's coming down, it's coming down)</p>
