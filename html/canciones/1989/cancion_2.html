	<h1>Blank Space</h1>
	<p>Nice to meet you, where you been?<br>
I could show you incredible things<br>
Magic, madness, heaven, sin<br>
Saw you there and I thought<br><br>
Oh, my God, look at that face!
You look like my next mistake<br>
Love's a game, wanna play?<br>
<br>
New money, suit and tie<br>
I can read you like a magazine<br>
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly<br>
And I know you heard about me<br>
So hey, let's be friends<br>
I'm dying to see how this one ends<br>
Grab your passport and my hand<br>
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend<br>
<br>
So it's gonna be forever<br>
Or it's gonna go down in flames?<br>
You can tell me when it's over<br>
If the high was worth the pain<br>
Got a long list of ex-lovers<br>
They'll tell you I'm insane<br>
'Cause you know I love the players<br>
And you love the game<br>
<br>
'Cause we're young and we're reckless<br>
We'll take this way too far<br>
It'll leave you breathless<br>
Or with a nasty scar<br>
Got a long list of ex-lovers<br>
They'll tell you I'm insane<br>
But I've got a blank space, baby<br>
And I'll write your name<br>
<br>
Cherry lips, crystal skies<br>
I could show you incredible things<br>
Stolen kisses, pretty lies<br>
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen<br>
Find out what you want<br>
Be that girl for a month<br>
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no<br>
<br>
Screaming, crying, perfect storms<br>
I can make all the tables turn<br>
Rose garden filled with thorns<br>
Keep you second guessing like<br>
Oh, my God, who is she?<br>
I get drunk on jealousy<br>
But you'll come back each time you leave<br>
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream<br>
<br>
So it's gonna be forever<br>
Or it's gonna go down in flames?<br>
You can tell me when it's over<br>
If the high was worth the pain<br>
Got a long list of ex-lovers<br>
They'll tell you I'm insane<br>
'Cause you know I love the players<br>
And you love the game<br>
<br>
'Cause we're young and we're reckless<br>
We'll take this way too far<br>
It'll leave you breathless<br>
Or with a nasty scar<br>
Got a long list of ex-lovers<br>
They'll tell you I'm insane<br>
But I've got a blank space, baby<br>
And I'll write your name<br>
<br>
Boys only want love if it's torture<br>
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya<br>
Boys only want love if it's torture<br>
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya<br>
<br>
So it's gonna be forever<br>
Or it's gonna go down in flames?<br>
You can tell me when it's over<br>
If the high was worth the pain<br>
Got a long list of ex-lovers<br>
They'll tell you I'm insane<br>
'Cause you know I love the players<br>
And you love the game<br>
<br>
'Cause we're young and we're reckless<br>
We'll take this way too far<br>
It'll leave you breathless<br>
Or with a nasty scar<br>
Got a long list of ex-lovers<br>
They'll tell you I'm insane<br>
But I've got a blank space, baby<br>
And I'll write your name</p>
