	<h1>All You Had To Do Was Stay</h1>
	<p>People like you always want back the love they gave away<br>
And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed<br>
The more I think about it now, the less I know<br>
All I know is that you drove us off the road<br>
<br>
Stay<br>
Hey, all you had to do was stay<br>
Had me in the palm of your hand<br>
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?<br>
Hey, now you say you want it back<br>
Now that it's just too late<br>
Well, it could've been easy<br>
All you had to do was (stay)<br>
<br>
All you had to do was (stay)<br>
All you had to do was (stay)<br>
All you had to do was (stay)<br>
All you had to do was stay<br>
<br>
Here you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say<br>
I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made<br>
People like you always want back the love they pushed aside<br>
But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye<br>
<br>
Hey, all you had to do was stay<br>
Had me in the palm of your hand<br>
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?<br>
Hey, now you say you want it back<br>
Now that it's just too late<br>
Well, it could've been easy<br>
All you had to do was (stay)<br>
<br>
All you had to do was (stay)<br>
All you had to do was (stay)<br>
All you had to do was (stay, stay, stay, stay, stay)<br>
<br>
Let me remind you<br>
This was what you wanted (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)<br>
You ended it<br>
You were all I wanted (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)<br>
But not like this<br>
Not like this<br>
Not like this<br>
Oh, all you had to do was (stay)<br>
<br>
Hey, all you had to do was stay<br>
Had me in the palm of your hand<br>
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?<br>
Hey, now you say you want it back<br>
Now that it's just too late<br>
Well, it could've been easy<br>
All you had to do was (stay)<br>
Hey, all you had to do was stay<br>
Had me in the palm of your hand<br>
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?<br>
<br>
Hey, now you say you want it back<br>
Now that it's just too late<br>
Well, it could've been easy (all you had to do was stay)<br>
All you had to do was (stay)<br>
<br>
All you had to do was (stay)<br>
All you had to do was (stay)<br>
All you had to do was (stay)<br>
All you had to do was (stay)</p>
