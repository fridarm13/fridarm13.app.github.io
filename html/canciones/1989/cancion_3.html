	<h1>Style</h1>
	<p>Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights<br>
A long drive<br>
Could end in burning flames or paradise<br>
<br>
Fade into view, oh<br>
It's been a while since I have even heard from you<br>
(Heard from you)<br>
<br>
And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I<br>
Know exactly where it leads, but I<br>
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time<br>
<br>
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye<br>
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like<br>
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time<br>
'Cause we never go out of style<br>
We never go out of style<br>
<br>
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt<br>
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt<br>
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time<br>
'Cause we never go out of style<br>
We never go out of style<br>
<br>
So it goes<br>
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road<br>
Takes me home<br>
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat<br>
<br>
I say: I heard, oh<br>
That you've been out and about with some other girl<br>
(Some other girl)<br>
<br>
He says: What you heard is true, but I<br>
Can't stop thinking about you, and I<br>
I said: I've been there too, a few times<br>
<br>
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye<br>
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like<br>
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time<br>
'Cause we never go out of style<br>
We never go out of style<br>
<br>
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt<br>
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt <br>(a tight little skirt)<br>
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time<br>
'Cause we never go out of style (we never go, we never go)<br>
We never go out of style<br>
<br>
Take me home<br>
Just take me home<br>
Yeah, just take me home<br>
Oh, oh, oh<br>
(Out of style)<br>
<br>
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye<br>
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like<br>
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time <br>(and when we go)<br>
'Cause we never go out of style<br>
We never go out of style</p>
