	<h1>Fifteen (Taylorâ€™s Version)</h1>
	<p>You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors<br>
It's the morning of your very first day<br>
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while<br>
Try and stay out of everybody's way<br>
<br>
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here<br>
For the next four years in this town<br>
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say<br>
You know I haven't seen you around, before<br>
<br>
'Cause when you're fifteen and<br>
Somebody tells you they love you<br>
You're gonna believe them<br>
And when you're fifteen<br>
Feeling like there's nothing to figure out<br>
Well, count to ten, take it in, this is life<br>
Before you know who you're gonna be<br>
At fifteen<br>
<br>
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail<br>
And soon enough you're best friends<br>
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool<br>
We'll be out of here as soon as we can<br>
<br>
And then you're on your very first date, and he's got a car<br>
And you're feeling like flying<br>
And your mama's waiting up, and you're thinking he's the one<br>
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends<br>
When the night ends<br>
<br>
'Cause when you're fifteen and<br>
Somebody tells you they love you<br>
You're gonna believe them<br>
And when you're fifteen<br>
And your first kiss makes you head spin 'round<br>
But in your life you'll do things greater than<br>
Dating the boy on the football team<br>
But I didn't know it at fifteen<br>
<br>
When all you wanted<br>
Was to be wanted<br>
Wish you could go back<br>
And tell yourself what you know now<br>
<br>
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday<br>
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine<br>
And Abigail gave everything she had<br>
To a boy who changed his mind<br>
And we both cried<br>
<br>
'Cause when you're fifteen and<br>
Somebody tells you they love you<br>
You're gonna believe them<br>
And when you're fifteen<br>
Don't forget to look before you fall<br>
I've found time can heal most anything<br>
And you just might find who you're supposed to be<br>
I didn't know who I was supposed to be<br>
At fifteen<br>
<br>
At your very first day<br>
Oh, take a deep breath, girl<br>
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors</p>
