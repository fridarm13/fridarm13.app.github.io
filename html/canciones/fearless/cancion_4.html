	<h1>Hey Stephen (Taylorâ€™s Version)</h1>
	<p>Yeah<br>
<br>
Hey, Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving<br>
But I know I saw a light in you<br>
And as we walked, we were talking and I didn't say<br>
Half the things I wanted to<br>
<br>
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window<br>
I'll be the one waiting there, even when it's cold<br>
Hey, Stephen, boy, you might have me believing<br>
I don't always have to be alone<br>
<br>
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel<br>
Can't help it if I want to kiss you in the rain<br>
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you<br>
Can't help it if there's no one else<br>
I can't help myself<br>
<br>
Hey, Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling<br>
So I've got some things to say to you, huh<br>
I seen it all so I thought, but I never seen<br>
Nobody shine the way you do<br>
<br>
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name<br>
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change<br>
Hey, Stephen, why are people always leaving?<br>
I think you and I should stay the same<br>
<br>
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel<br>
Can't help it if I want to kiss you in the rain<br>
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you<br>
Can't help it if there's no one else<br>
I can't help myself<br>
<br>
They're dimming the streets lights<br>
You're perfect for me<br>
Why aren't you here tonight?<br>
I'm waiting alone now<br>
So come on and come out<br>
And pull me near<br>
And shine, shine, shine<br>
<br>
Hey, Stephen, I could give to you fifty reasons<br>
Why I should be the one you choose<br>
Well, all those other girls, well, they're beautiful<br>
But would they write a song for you?<br>
<br>
I can't help it if you look like an angel<br>
Can't help it if I want to kiss you in the rain<br>
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you<br>
Can't help it if there's no one else<br>
<br>
I can't help myself if you look like an angel<br>
Can't help it if I want to kiss you in the rain<br>
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you<br>
Can't help it if there's no one else<br>
I can't help myself<br>
<br>
Myself<br>
Can't help myself<br>
I can't help myself<br>
Oh, oh, oh</p>
