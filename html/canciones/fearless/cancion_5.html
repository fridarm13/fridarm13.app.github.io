	<h1>White Horse (Taylorâ€™s Version)</h1>
	<p>Say you're sorry, that face of an angel<br>
Comes out just when you need it to<br>
As I paced back and forth all this time<br>
'Cause I honestly believed in you<br>
<br>
Holding on the days drag on<br>
Stupid girl, I should've known, I should've known<br>
<br>
That I'm not a princess<br>
This ain't a fairytale<br>
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet<br>
Lead her up the stairwell<br>
<br>
This ain't Hollywood<br>
This is a small town<br>
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down<br>
Now it's too late for you and your white horse<br>
To come around<br>
<br>
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes<br>
And never really had a chance<br>
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love<br>
You had to fight to have the upper hand<br>
<br>
I had so many dreams about you and me<br>
Happy endings, but now I know<br>
<br>
That I'm not a princess<br>
This ain't a fairytale<br>
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet<br>
Lead her up the stairwell<br>
<br>
This ain't Hollywood<br>
This is a small town<br>
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down<br>
Now it's too late for you and your white horse<br>
To come around<br>
<br>
And there you are on your knees<br>
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me<br>
Just like I always wanted, but I'm so sorry<br>
<br>
'Cause I'm not your princess<br>
This ain't a fairytale<br>
I'm gonna find someone someday<br>
Who might actually treat me well<br>
<br>
This is a big world<br>
That was a small town<br>
There in my rearview mirror disappearing now<br>
And it's too late for you and your white horse<br>
Now it's too late for you and your white horse<br>
To catch me now<br>
<br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
Try and catch me now<br>
It's too late to catch me now</p>
