	<h1>Fearless (Taylorâ€™s Version)</h1>
	<p>There's something about the way<br>
The street looks when it's just rained<br>
There's a glow off the pavement<br>
You walk me to the car<br>
And you know I want to ask you to dance right there<br>
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah<br>
Oh, yeah<br>
<br>
We're drivin' down the road<br>
I wonder if you know<br>
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now<br>
But you're just so cool<br>
Run your hands through your hair<br>
Absentmindedly makin' me want you<br>
<br>
And I don't know how it gets better than this<br>
You take my hand and drag me headfirst<br>
Fearless<br>
		<br>
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance<br>
In a storm in my best dress<br>
Fearless<br>
<br>
So baby, drive slow<br>
Till we run out of road<br>
In this one-horse town<br>
I want to stay right here<br>
In this passenger seat<br>
You put your eyes on me<br>
In this moment now, capture it, remember it<br>
<br>
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this<br>
You take my hand and drag me headfirst<br>
Fearless<br>
<br>
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance<br>
In a storm in my best dress<br>
Fearless<br>
<br>
Well, you stood there with me in the doorway<br>
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way, but<br>
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave<br>
It's a first kiss, it's flawless, really something<br>
It's fearless<br>
<br>
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this<br>
You take my hand and drag me headfirst<br>
Fearless<br>
<br>
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance<br>
In a storm in my best dress<br>
Fearless<br>
<br>
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this<br>
You take my hand and drag me headfirst<br>
Fearless<br>
<br>
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance<br>
In a storm in my best dress<br>
Fearless</p>
