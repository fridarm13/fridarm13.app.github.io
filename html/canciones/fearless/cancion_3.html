	<h1>Love Story (Taylorâ€™s Version)</h1>
	<p>We were both young when I first saw you<br>
I close my eyes and the flashback starts<br>
I'm standing there<br>
On a balcony in summer air<br>
<br>
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns<br>
See you make your way through the crowd<br>
And say: Hello<br>
Little did I know<br>
<br>
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles<br>
And my daddy said: Stay away from Juliet<br>
And I was crying on the staircase<br>
Begging you: Please, don't go<br>
<br>
And I said: Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone<br>
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run<br>
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess<br>
It's a love story, baby, just say yes<br>
<br>
So I sneak out to the garden to see you<br>
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew<br>
So close your eyes<br>
Escape this town for a little while, uh, oh<br>
<br>
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter<br>
And my daddy said: Stay away from Juliet<br>
But you were everything to me<br>
I was begging you: Please, don't go<br>
<br>
And I said: Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone<br>
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run<br>
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess<br>
It's a love story, baby, just say yes<br>
<br>
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel<br>
This love is difficult, but it's real<br>
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess<br>
It's a love story, baby, just say yes<br>
Oh, oh<br>
<br>
I got tired of waiting<br>
Wondering if you were ever coming around<br>
My faith in you was fading<br>
When I met you on the outskirts of town<br>
<br>
And I said: Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone<br>
I keep waiting for you, but you never come<br>
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think<br>
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring<br>
<br>
And said: Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone<br>
I love you and that's all I really know<br>
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress<br>
It's a love story, baby, just say yes<br>
<br>
Oh, oh, oh<br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you</p>
