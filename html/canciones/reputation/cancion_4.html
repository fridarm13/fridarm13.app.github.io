	<h1>Donâ€™t Blame Me</h1>
	<p>Don't blame me, love made me crazy<br>
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right<br>
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby<br>
I'll be using for the rest of my life<br>
<br>
I've been breaking hearts a long time<br>
And toying with them older guys<br>
Just playthings for me to use<br>
Something happened for the first time<br>
In the darkest little paradise<br>
Shaking, pacing, I just need you<br>
<br>
For you, I would cross the line<br>
I would waste my time<br>
I would lose my mind<br>
They say: She's gone too far this time<br>
<br>
Don't blame me, love made me crazy<br>
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right<br>
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby<br>
I'll be using for the rest of my life<br>
<br>
Don't blame me, love made me crazy<br>
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right<br>
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby<br>
I'll be using for the rest of my life<br>
<br>
My name is whatever you decide<br>
And I'm just gonna call you mine<br>
I'm insane, but I'm your baby<br>
Echoes of your name inside my mind<br>
Halo, hiding my obsession<br>
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy<br>
<br>
And, baby, for you, I would fall from grace<br>
Just to touch your face<br>
If you walk away<br>
I'd beg you on my knees to stay<br>
<br>
Don't blame me, love made me crazy<br>
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right<br>
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby<br>
I'll be using for the rest of my life<br>
<br>
Don't blame me, love made me crazy<br>
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right<br>
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby<br>
I'll be using for the rest of my life<br>
<br>
I get so high (oh)<br>
Every time you're, every time you're loving me<br>
You're loving me<br>
Trip of my life (oh)<br>
Every time you're, every time you're touching me<br>
You're touching me<br>
Every time you're, every time you're loving me<br>
<br>
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby<br>
I'll be using for the rest of my life<br>
(Using for the rest of my life, oh)<br>
<br>
Don't blame me, love made me crazy<br>
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right (doing it right)<br>
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby<br>
I'll be using for the rest of my life (oh)<br>
<br>
Don't blame me, love made me crazy<br>
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right (doing, doing it right)<br>
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby<br>
I'll be using for the rest of my life<br>
<br>
I get so high (oh)<br>
Every time you're, every time you're loving me<br>
You're loving me<br>
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby<br>
I'll be using for the rest of my life</p>
