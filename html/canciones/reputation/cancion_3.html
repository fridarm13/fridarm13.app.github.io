	<h1>I Did Something Bad</h1>
	<p>I never trust a narcissist, but they love me<br>
So I play 'em like a violin<br>
And I make it look, oh, so easy<br>
'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three<br>
This is how the world works<br>
Now all he thinks about is me<br>
<br>
I can feel the flames on my skin<br>
Crimson red paint on my lips<br>
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing<br>
I don't regret it one bit 'cause he had it coming<br>
<br>
They say I did something bad<br>
Then why's it feel so good?<br>
They say I did something bad<br>
But why's it feel so good?<br>
Most fun I ever had<br>
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could<br>
It just felt so good, good<br>
<br>
I never trust a playboy, but they love me<br>
So I fly 'em all around the world<br>
And I let them think they saved me<br>
They never see it coming what I do next<br>
This is how the world works<br>
You gotta leave before you get left<br>
<br>
I can feel the flames on my skin<br>
He says: Don't throw away a good thing<br>
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothing<br>
And if he spends my change, then he had it coming<br>
<br>
They say I did something bad<br>
Then why's it feel so good?<br>
They say I did something bad<br>
But why's it feel so good?<br>
Most fun I ever had<br>
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could<br>
It just felt so good, good<br>
<br>
It just felt so good<br>
<br>
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one<br>
They got their pitchforks and proof<br>
Their receipts and reasons<br>
They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one<br>
So light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)<br>
Light me up, go ahead and light me up (light me up)<br>
Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)<br>
Light me up (light me up), light me up<br>
<br>
They say I did something bad (oh)<br>
Then why's it feel so good? (So good)<br>
They say I did something bad<br>
But why's it feel so good? (Good)<br>
Most fun I ever had (most fun I ever had)<br>
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could<br>
It just felt so good (good), good<br>
<br>
Oh, you say I did something bad<br>
(You say I did something bad)<br>
But why's it feel so good, good?<br>
So bad, why's it feel so good?<br>
Why's it feel, why's it feel so good? (Bad)<br>
It just felt so good, good</p>
