	<h1>...Ready For It?</h1>
	<p>Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him<br>
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted<br>
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom<br>
Holding him for ransom, some<br>
Some boys are trying too hard, he don't try at all, though<br>
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so<br>
I see nothing better, I keep him forever<br>
Like a vendetta-ta<br>
<br>
I-I-I see how this is gon' go<br>
Touch me and you'll never be alone<br>
I-Island breeze and lights down low<br>
No one has to know<br>
<br>
In the middle of the night, in my dreams<br>
You should see the things we do, baby, hm<br>
In the middle of the night, in my dreams<br>
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time<br>
Are you ready for it?<br>
<br>
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me<br>
Stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry<br>
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist<br>
And we'll move to an island, and<br>
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor (hey!)<br>
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure (hey)<br>
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now<br>
Never be the same now, now<br>
<br>
I-I-I see how this is gon' go (go)<br>
Touch me and you'll never be alone<br>
I-Island breeze and lights down low (low)<br>
No one has to know<br>
(No one has to know)<br>
<br>
In the middle of the night, in my dreams<br>
You should see the things we do, baby, hm<br>
In the middle of the night, in my dreams<br>
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time<br>
Are you ready for it?<br>
Ooh<br>
Are you ready for it?<br>
<br>
Baby, let the games begin<br>
Let the games begin<br>
Let the games begin<br>
Baby, let the games begin<br>
Let the games begin<br>
Let the games begin<br>
<br>
I-I-I see how this is gon' go<br>
Touch me and you'll never be alone<br>
I-Island breeze and lights down low<br>
No one has to know<br>
<br>
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (in my dreams)<br>
You should see the things we do,(we do) baby,(baby) hm<br>
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (my dreams)<br>
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time<br>
<br>
In the middle of the night<br>
Baby, let the games begin<br>
Let the games begin<br>
Let the games begin<br>
Are you ready for it?<br>
Baby, let the games begin<br>
Let the games begin<br>
Let the games begin<br>
Are you ready for it?</p>
