	<h1>Delicate</h1>
	<p>This ain't for the best<br>
My reputation's never been worse, so<br>
You must like me for me<br>
We can't make<br>
Any promises now, can we, babe?<br>
But you can make me a drink<br>
<br>
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?<br>
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black<br>
Come here, you can meet me in the back<br>
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you<br>
Oh, damn, never seen that color blue<br>
Just think of the fun things we could do<br>
<br>
('Cause I like you)<br>
This ain't for the best<br>
My reputation's never been worse, so<br>
You must like me for me<br>
(Yeah, I want you)<br>
We can't make<br>
Any promises now, can we, babe?<br>
But you can make me a drink<br>
<br>
Is it cool that I said all that?<br>
Is it chill that you're in my head?<br>
'Cause I know that it's delicate<br>
(Delicate)<br>
Is it cool that I said all that?<br>
Is it too soon to do this yet?<br>
'Cause I know that it's delicate<br>
<br>
Isn't it, isn't it, isn't it?<br>
Isn't it?<br>
Isn't it, isn't it, isn't it?<br>
Isn't it delicate?<br>
<br>
Third floor on the West Side, me and you<br>
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view<br>
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?<br>
Long night with your hands up in my hair<br>
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs<br>
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share<br>
<br>
('Cause I like you)<br>
This ain't for the best<br>
My reputation's never been worse, so<br>
You must like me for me<br>
(Yeah, I want you)<br>
We can't make<br>
Any promises now, can we, babe?<br>
But you can make me a drink<br>
<br>
Is it cool that I said all that?<br>
Is it chill that you're in my head?<br>
'Cause I know that it's delicate<br>
(Delicate)<br>
Is it cool that I said all that?<br>
Is it too soon to do this yet?<br>
'Cause I know that it's delicate<br>
<br>
Isn't it, isn't it, isn't it?<br>
Isn't it?<br>
Isn't it, isn't it, isn't it?<br>
Isn't it delicate?<br>
<br>
Sometimes, I wonder: When you sleep<br>
Are you ever dreaming of me?<br>
Sometimes, when I look into your eyes<br>
I pretend you're mine, all the damn time<br>
<br>
('Cause I like you)<br>
Is it cool that I said all that?<br>
Is it chill that you're in my head?<br>
'Cause I know that it's delicate<br>
(Delicate)<br>
(Yeah, I want you)<br>
Is it cool that I said all that?<br>
Is it too soon to do this yet?<br>
'Cause I know that it's delicate<br>
(Delicate)<br>
<br>
('Cause I like you)<br>
Is it cool that I said all that? (Isn't it?)<br>
Is it chill that you're in my head? (Isn't it, isn't it?)<br>
'Cause I know that it's delicate<br>
(Isn't it delicate?)<br>
(Yeah, I want you)<br>
Is it cool that I said all that? (Isn't it?)<br>
Is it too soon to do this yet? (Isn't it, isn't it?)<br>
'Cause I know that it's delicate<br>
Isn't it delicate?</p>
