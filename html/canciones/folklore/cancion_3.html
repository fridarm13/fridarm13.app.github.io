	<h1>The Last Great American Dynasty</h1>
	<p>Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny<br>
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis<br>
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money<br>
And the town said: How did a middle-class divorcée do it?<br>
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche<br>
There's only so far new money goes<br>
They picked out a home and called it Holiday House<br>
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud<br>
The doctor had told him to settle down<br>
It must have been her fault his heart gave out<br>
And they said<br>
<br>
There goes the last great American dynasty<br>
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been<br>
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen<br>
She had a marvelous time ruining everything<br>
<br>
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever<br>
Flew in all her bitch pack friends from the city<br>
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names<br>
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet<br>
And losing on card game bets with Dalí<br>
And they said<br>
<br>
There goes the last great American dynasty<br>
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been<br>
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen<br>
She had a marvelous time ruining everything<br>
<br>
They say she was seen on occasion<br>
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea<br>
And in a feud with her neighbor<br>
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green<br>
Fifty years is a long time<br>
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach<br>
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits<br>
And then it was bought by me<br>
<br>
Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been<br>
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen<br>
I had a marvelous time ruining everything<br>
<br>
I had a marvelous time ruining everything<br>
A marvelous time ruining everything<br>
A marvelous time<br>
I had a marvelous time</p>
