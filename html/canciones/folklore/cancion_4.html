	<h1>Exile (Featuring Bon Iver)</h1>
	<p>I can see you standing, honey<br>
With his arms around your body<br>
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all<br>
<br>
And it took you five whole minutes<br>
To pack us up and leave me with it<br>
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall<br>
<br>
I think I've seen this film before<br>
And I didn't like the ending<br>
You're not my homeland anymore<br>
So what am I defending now?<br>
You were my town<br>
Now I'm in exile, seein' you out<br>
I think I've seen this film before<br>
<br>
I can see you starin', honey<br>
Like he's just your understudy<br>
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me<br>
<br>
Second, third, and hundredth chances<br>
Balancin' on breaking branches<br>
Those eyes add insult to injury<br>
<br>
I think I've seen this film before<br>
And I didn't like the ending<br>
I'm not your problem anymore<br>
So who am I offending now?<br>
You were my crown<br>
Now I'm in exile, seein' you out<br>
I think I've seen this film before<br>
So I'm leavin' out the side door<br>
<br>
So step right out, there is no amount<br>
Of crying I can do for you<br>
<br>
All this time<br>
We always walked a very thin line<br>
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)<br>
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)<br>
<br>
All this time<br>
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)<br>
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)<br>
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)<br>
<br>
So many signs, so many signs<br>
You didn't even see the signs<br>
<br>
I think I've seen this film before<br>
And I didn't like the ending<br>
You're not my homeland anymore<br>
So what am I defending now?<br>
You were my town<br>
Now I'm in exile, seein' you out<br>
I think I've seen this film before<br>
So I'm leavin' out the side door<br>
<br>
So step right out, there is no amount<br>
Of crying I can do for you<br>
<br>
All this time<br>
We always walked a very thin line<br>
You didn't even hear me out (Didn't even hear me out)<br>
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)<br>
<br>
All this time<br>
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)<br>
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)<br>
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)<br>
<br>
All this time (So many signs)<br>
I never learned to read your mind (So many signs)<br>
I couldn't turn things around (I couldn't turn things around)<br>
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign)<br>
You never gave a warning sign<br>
Ah, ah</p>
