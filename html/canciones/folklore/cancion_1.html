	<h1>The 1</h1>
	<p>I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit<br>
Been saying yes instead of no<br>
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though<br>
I hit the ground running each night<br>
I hit the Sunday matinée<br>
You know, the greatest films of all time were never made<br>
<br>
I guess you never know, never know<br>
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed<br>
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow<br>
And it's alright now<br>
<br>
But we were something, don't you think so?<br>
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool<br>
And if my wishes came true<br>
It would've been you<br>
In my defense, I have none<br>
For never leaving well enough alone<br>
But it would've been fun<br>
If you would've been the one<br>
(Ooh)<br>
<br>
I had this dream you're doing cool shit<br>
Having adventures on your own<br>
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home<br>
We never painted by the numbers, baby<br>
But we were making it count<br>
You know, the greatest loves of all time are over now<br>
<br>
I guess you never know, never know<br>
And it's another day waking up alone<br>
<br>
But we were something, don't you think so?<br>
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool<br>
And if my wishes came true<br>
It would've been you<br>
In my defense, I have none<br>
For never leaving well enough alone<br>
But it would've been fun<br>
If you would've been the one<br>
<br>
I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you<br>
If one thing had been different<br>
Would everything be different today?<br>
<br>
We were something, don't you think so?<br>
Rosé flowing with your chosen family<br>
And it would've been sweet<br>
If it could've been me<br>
In my defense, I have none<br>
For digging up the grave another time<br>
But it would've been fun<br>
If you would've been the one<br>
(Ooh)</p>
