	<h1>My Tears Ricochet</h1>
	<p>We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room<br>
And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too<br>
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe<br>
All the hell you gave me?<br>
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you<br>
'Til my dying day<br>
<br>
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace<br>
And you're the hero flying around, saving face<br>
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?<br>
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed<br>
Look at how my tears ricochet<br>
<br>
We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean<br>
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring<br>
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you<br>
But what a ghostly scene<br>
You wear the same jewels that I gave you<br>
As you bury me<br>
<br>
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace<br>
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave<br>
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?<br>
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed<br>
Look at how my tears ricochet<br>
<br>
And I can go anywhere I want<br>
Anywhere I want, just not home<br>
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood<br>
But you would still miss me in your bones<br>
And I still talk to you (when I'm screaming at the sky)<br>
And when you can't sleep at night (you hear my stolen lullabies)<br>
<br>
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace<br>
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves<br>
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same<br>
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed<br>
You turned into your worst fears<br>
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain<br>
Crossing out the good years<br>
And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed<br>
Look at how my tears ricochet<br>
Ah, ah</p>
