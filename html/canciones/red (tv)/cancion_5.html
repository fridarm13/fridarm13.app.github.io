	<h1>All Too Well (Taylor's Version)</h1>
	<p>I walked through the door with you, the air was cold<br>
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow<br>
And I, left my scarf there, at your sister's house<br>
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now<br>
<br>
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze<br>
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate<br>
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place<br>
And I can picture it after all these days<br>
<br>
And I know it's long gone<br>
And that magic's not here no more<br>
And I might be okay<br>
But I'm not fine at all<br>
<br>
'Cause there we are again on that little town street<br>
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me<br>
Wind in my hair, I was there<br>
I remember it all too well<br>
<br>
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red<br>
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed<br>
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the Tee-ball team<br>
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me<br>
<br>
And I know it's long gone<br>
And there was nothing else I could do<br>
And I forget about you long enough<br>
To forget why I needed to<br>
<br>
'Cause there we are again, in the middle of the night<br>
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light<br>
Down the stairs, I was there<br>
I remember it all too well<br>
<br>
And maybe we got lost in translation<br>
Maybe I asked for too much<br>
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up<br>
Running scared, I was there<br>
I remember it all too well<br>
<br>
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise<br>
So casually cruel in the name of being honest<br>
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here<br>
'Cause I remember it all, all, all<br>
Too well<br>
<br>
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralysed by it<br>
I'd like to be my old self again<br>
But I'm still trying to find it<br>
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own<br>
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone<br>
<br>
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week<br>
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me<br>
You can't get rid of it<br>
'Cause you remember it all too well<br>
<br>
'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so<br>
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known<br>
It was rare, I was there<br>
I remember it all too well<br>
<br>
Wind in my hair, you were there<br>
You remember it all<br>
Down the stairs, you were there<br>
You remember it all<br>
It was rare, I was there<br>
I remember it all too well</p>
