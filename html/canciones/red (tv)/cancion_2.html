	<h1>Red (Taylor's Version)</h1>
	<p>Loving him is like driving a new Maserati<br>
Down a dead end street<br>
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin<br>
Ending so suddenly<br>
<br>
Loving him is like trying to change your mind<br>
Once you're already flying through the free fall<br>
Like the colours in autumn, so bright<br>
Just before they lose it all<br>
<br>
Losing him was blue, like I'd never known<br>
Missing him was dark gray, all alone<br>
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met<br>
But loving him was red (red, red, red, red)<br>
Loving him was red (red, red, red, red)<br>
<br>
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted<br>
Was right there in front of you<br>
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words<br>
To your old favorite song<br>
<br>
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword<br>
And realizing there's no right answer<br>
Regretting him was like wishing you'd never found out<br>
That love could be that strong<br>
<br>
Losing him was blue, like I'd never known<br>
Missing him was dark gray, all alone<br>
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met<br>
But loving him was red (red, red)<br>
Oh, red (red, red)<br>
Burning red (red, red, red, red)<br>
<br>
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes<br>
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go<br>
But moving on from him is impossible<br>
When I still see it all in my head<br>
In burning red<br>
<br>
Burning, it was red<br>
<br>
Oh, losing him was blue, like I'd never known<br>
Missing him was dark gray, all alone<br>
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met<br>
'Cause loving him was red (red, red)<br>
Yeah, yeah, red (red, red)<br>
Oh, burning red (red, red, red, red)<br>
<br>
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head<br>
Comes back to me burning red (red, red)<br>
Yeah, yeah (red, red)<br>
<br>
His love was like driving a new Maserati<br>
Down a dead end street</p>
