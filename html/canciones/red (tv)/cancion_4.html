	<h1>I Knew You Were Trouble (Taylor's Version)</h1>
	<p>Once upon time<br>
A few mistakes ago<br>
I was in your sights<br>
You got me alone<br>
<br>
You found me<br>
You found me<br>
You found me<br>
<br>
I guess you didn't care<br>
And I guess I liked that<br>
And when I fell hard<br>
You took a step back<br>
<br>
Without me<br>
Without me<br>
Without me<br>
<br>
And he's long gone when he's next to me<br>
And I realize the blame is on me<br>
<br>
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in<br>
So shame on me now<br>
Flew me to places I'd never been<br>
'Till you put me down, oh<br>
<br>
I knew you were trouble when you walked in<br>
So shame on me now<br>
Flew me to places I'd never been<br>
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground<br>
<br>
Oh, oh<br>
Trouble, trouble, trouble<br>
Oh, oh<br>
Trouble, trouble, trouble<br>
<br>
No apologies<br>
He'll never see you cry<br>
Pretend he doesn't know<br>
That he's the reason why<br>
<br>
You're drowning<br>
You're drowning<br>
You're drowning<br>
<br>
And I heard you moved on<br>
From whispers on the street<br>
A new notch in your belt<br>
Is all I'll ever be<br>
<br>
And now I see<br>
Now I see<br>
Now I see<br>
<br>
He was long gone when he met me<br>
And I realize the joke is on me, hey!<br>
<br>
I knew you were trouble when you walked in<br>
So shame on me now<br>
Flew me to places I'd never been<br>
'Till you put me down, oh<br>
<br>
I knew you were trouble when you walked in<br>
So shame on me now<br>
Flew me to places I'd never been (yeah)<br>
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground<br>
<br>
Oh, oh (yeah)<br>
Trouble, trouble, trouble<br>
Oh, oh<br>
Trouble, trouble, trouble<br>
<br>
And the saddest fear<br>
Comes creeping in<br>
That you never loved me<br>
Or her, or anyone, or anything<br>
Yeah!<br>
<br>
I knew you were trouble when you walked in<br>
So shame on me now<br>
Flew me to places I'd never been (I'd never been)<br>
'Till you put me down, oh<br>
<br>
I knew you were trouble when you walked in<br>
So shame on me now<br>
Flew me to places I'd never been<br>
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground<br>
<br>
Oh, oh<br>
Trouble, trouble, trouble<br>
Oh, oh<br>
Trouble, trouble, trouble<br>
<br>
I knew you were trouble when you walked in<br>
Trouble, trouble, trouble<br>
I knew you were trouble when you walked in<br>
Trouble, trouble, trouble</p>
