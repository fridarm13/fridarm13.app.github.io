	<h1>Cruel Summer</h1>
	<p>(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
<br>
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night<br>
You know that I caught it (oh, yeah, you're right, I want it)<br>
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price<br>
You know that I bought it (oh, yeah, you're right, I want it)<br>
<br>
Killing me slow, out the window<br>
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below<br>
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes<br>
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more<br>
<br>
And it's new, the shape of your body<br>
It's blue, the feeling I've got<br>
And it's ooh, whoa oh<br>
It's a cruel summer<br>
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em<br>
No rules in breakable heaven<br>
But ooh, whoa oh<br>
It's a cruel summer<br>
With you<br>
<br>
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine<br>
I'm not dying (oh, yeah, you're right, I want it)<br>
You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times<br>
We're not trying (oh, yeah, you're right, I want it)<br>
<br>
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife<br>
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone<br>
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes<br>
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know<br>
<br>
Oh, it's new, the shape of your body<br>
It's blue, the feeling I've got<br>
And it's ooh, whoa oh<br>
It's a cruel summer<br>
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em<br>
No rules in breakable heaven<br>
But ooh, whoa oh<br>
It's a cruel summer<br>
With you<br>
<br>
I'm drunk in the back of the car<br>
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)<br>
Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true<br>
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you<br>
And I snuck in through the garden gate<br>
Every night that summer, just to seal my fate (oh)<br>
And I screamed for whatever it's worth<br>
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?<br>
He looks up, grinning like a devil<br>
<br>
And it's new, the shape of your body<br>
It's blue, the feeling I've got<br>
And it's ooh, whoa oh<br>
It's a cruel summer<br>
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em<br>
No rules in breakable heaven<br>
But ooh, whoa oh<br><br>
It's a cruel summer
With you<br>
<br>
I'm drunk in the back of the car<br>
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)<br>
Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true<br>
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you<br>
And I snuck in through the garden gate<br>
Every night that summer, just to seal my fate (oh)<br>
And I screamed for whatever it's worth<br>
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?<br>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)</p>
