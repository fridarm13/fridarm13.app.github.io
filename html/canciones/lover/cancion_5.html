	<h1>The Archer</h1>
	<p>Combat, I'm ready for combat<br>
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?<br>
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies<br>
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you<br>
<br>
Easy they come, easy they go<br>
I jump from the train, I ride off alone<br>
I never grew up, it's getting so old<br>
Help me hold on to you<br>
<br>
I've been the archer<br>
I've been the prey<br>
Who could ever leave me, darling?<br>
But who could stay?<br>
<br>
Dark side, I search for your dark side<br>
But what if I'm all right, right, right, right here?<br>
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face<br>
Then I hate my reflection for years and years<br>
<br>
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost<br>
The room is on fire, invisible smoke<br>
And all of my heroes died all alone<br>
Help me hold on to you<br>
<br>
I've been the archer<br>
I've been the prey<br>
Screaming: Who could ever leave me, darling?<br>
But who could stay?<br>
(I see right through me, I see right through me)<br>
<br>
'Cause they see right through me<br>
They see right through me<br>
They see right through<br>
Can you see right through me?<br>
They see right through<br>
They see right through me<br>
I see right through me<br>
I see right through me<br>
<br>
All the king's horses, all the king's men<br>
Couldn't put me together again<br>
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends<br>
Help me hold on to you<br>
<br>
I've been the archer<br>
I've been the prey<br>
Who could ever leave me, darling?<br>
But who could stay?<br>
(I see right through me, I see right through me)<br>
<br>
Who could stay?<br>
Who could stay?<br>
Who could stay?<br>
You could stay<br>
You could stay<br>
<br>
Combat, I'm ready for combat</p>
