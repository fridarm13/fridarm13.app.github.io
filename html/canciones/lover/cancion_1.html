	<h1>I Forgot That You Existed</h1>
	<p>How many days did I spend thinking<br>
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?<br>
Lived in the shade you were throwing<br>
Till all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone<br>
And I couldn't get away from ya<br>
In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah<br>
Your name on my lips, tounge-tied<br>
Free rent, living in my mind<br>
<br>
But then something happened, one magical night<br>
<br>
I forgot that you existed<br>
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't<br>
And it was so nice<br>
So peaceful and quiet<br>
I forgot that you existed<br>
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference<br>
I forgot that you<br>
<br>
Got out some popcorn<br>
As soon as my rep started going down, down, down<br>
Laughed on the school yard<br>
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground<br>
And I would've stuck around for ya<br>
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah<br>
Would've been right there, front row<br>
Even if nobody came to your show<br>
<br>
But you showed who you are, then, one magical night<br>
<br>
I forgot that you existed<br>
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't<br>
And it was so nice<br>
So peaceful and quiet<br>
I forgot that you existed<br>
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference<br>
I forgot that you<br>
<br>
Sent me a clear message<br>
Taught me some hard lessons<br>
I just forget what they were<br>
It's all just a blur<br>
<br>
I forgot that you existed<br>
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't<br>
And it was so nice<br>
So peaceful and quiet<br>
I forgot that you existed<br>
I did, I did, I did<br>
It isn't hate, it's just indifference<br>
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference<br>
Oh, yeah</p>
